# ATM Machine Simulation in Java

This is a simple command-line ATM machine simulation developed in Java. The application allows users to perform basic banking operations such as checking account balance, withdrawing money, and depositing money, all after entering a valid PIN.

## Features

- **Check Account Balance**: View the current balance of the account.
- **Withdraw Money**: Withdraw a specified amount from the account, with checks for sufficient funds.
- **Deposit Money**: Deposit a specified amount to the account.
- **PIN Verification**: The user must enter a valid PIN to access the ATM functions (default PIN is `4455`).

## How It Works

1. **PIN Entry**: The user is prompted to enter a 4-digit PIN. If the entered PIN is incorrect, the user is prompted to re-enter the correct PIN.
2. **Main Menu**: Once the correct PIN is entered, the user is presented with the following options:
   - Check Account Balance
   - Withdraw Money
   - Deposit Money
   - Exit
3. **Balance Check**: Displays the current account balance.
4. **Withdraw Money**: The user can withdraw a specified amount if they have sufficient funds.
5. **Deposit Money**: The user can deposit a specified amount into the account.
6. **Exit**: Allows the user to exit the ATM system.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Java Development Kit (JDK)](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) installed on your machine.
- A Java IDE or command-line terminal to run the program.

### Running the Program

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Open the source code in your Java IDE or compile it from the terminal.
3. Run the `ATMMachine` class to start the program.

### Example Usage

```
Enter your pin: 
4455
Enter your choice : 
1. Check A/C Balance
2. Withdraw Money
3. Deposit Money
4. Exit
```

## Code Explanation

- **ATM class**: Contains the core methods to handle PIN verification, balance checking, withdrawal, deposit, and menu navigation.
  - `checkPin()`: Validates the entered PIN.
  - `menu()`: Displays the options menu and handles user input.
  - `checkBalance()`: Displays the current balance.
  - `withdrawMoney()`: Allows the user to withdraw money.
  - `depositMoney()`: Allows the user to deposit money.
  
- **ATMMachine class**: The entry point of the application.
